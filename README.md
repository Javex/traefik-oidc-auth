> This document always represents the latest version, which may not have been released yet.  
> Therefore, some features may not be available currently but will be available soon.
> You can use the GIT-Tags to check individual versions.

> [!WARNING]
> This middleware is under development and only tested against [ZITADEL](https://zitadel.com/) yet. Although it should be compatible with any OIDC-compatible IDP.

## ðŸ’¡ Getting Started

Enable the plugin in your traefik configuration.

```yml
experimental:

      moduleName: "github.com/sevensolutions/traefik-oidc-auth"
      version: "v0.2.0"
```

Add a middleware and reference it in a route.

```yml

      loadBalancer:
        servers:
          - url: http://whoami:80

  middlewares:
    oidc-auth:
      plugin:
