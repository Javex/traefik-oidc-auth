A traefik Plugin for securing the upstream service with OpenID Connect acting as a relying party.

> [!NOTE]
> This document always represents the latest version, which may not have been released yet.
> Therefore, some features may not be available currently but will be available soon.
> You can use the GIT-Tags to check individual versions.

> [!WARNING]
> This middleware is under development and only tested against [ZITADEL](https://zitadel.com/) yet. Although it should be compatible with any OIDC-compatible IDP.

## ðŸ’¡ Getting Started

Enable the plugin in your traefik configuration.

```yml
experimental:
  plugins:
    traefik-oidc-auth:
      moduleName: "github.com/sevensolutions/traefik-oidc-auth"
      version: "v0.2.0"
```

Add a middleware and reference it in a route.

```yml
http:
  services:
    whoami:
      loadBalancer:
        servers:
          - url: http://whoami:80

  middlewares:
    oidc-auth:
      plugin:
        traefik-oidc-auth:
          Provider:
            Url: "https://..."
            ClientId: "<YourClientId>"
            ClientSecret: "<YourClientSecret>"
            #UsePkce: true # Or use PKCE instead of a secret
          Scopes: ["openid", "profile", "email"]
          Authorization:
            AssertClaims:
              - Name: "preferred_username"

          Headers:
            MapClaims:
              - Claim: "preferred_username"
                Header: "X-Oidc-Username"
              - Claim: "sub"
                Header: "X-Oidc-Subject"

## ðŸ§ª Local Development

Create the following `.env` file:

```
PROVIDER_URL=...
CLIENT_ID=...
CLIENT_SECRET=...
```

The run `docker compose up` to run traefik locally.

Now browse to http://localhost:9080. You should be redirected to your IDP.
After you've logged in, you should be redirected back to http://localhost:9080 and see a WHOAMI page.
