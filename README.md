> You can use the GIT-Tags to check individual versions.

> [!WARNING]
> This middleware is under development and only tested against [ZITADEL](https://zitadel.com/) yet. Although it should be compatible with any OIDC-compatible IDP.

## ðŸ’¡ Getting Started

Enable the plugin in your traefik configuration.

```yml
experimental:
  plugins:
    traefik-oidc-auth:
      moduleName: "github.com/sevensolutions/traefik-oidc-auth"
      version: "v0.1.0"
```

Add a middleware and reference it in a route.

```yml
http:
  services:
    whoami:
      loadBalancer:
        servers:
          - url: http://whoami:80

  middlewares:
    oidc-auth:
      plugin:
        traefik-oidc-auth:
          Provider:
            Url: "https://..."
            ClientId: "<YourClientId>"
            ClientSecret: "<YourClientSecret>"
          Scopes: ["openid", "profile", "email"]

  routers:
    whoami:
      entryPoints: ["web"]
      rule: "HostRegexp(`.+`)"
      service: whoami
      middlewares: ["oidc-auth"]
